# battleship
2 player game currently in development. 

Done: backend game logic and unit tests

To Do:
  Clean up main.py. I know very little about pygame and this feels very hacky.
  Uncomment the rest of the ship types. They're currently commented for front-end testing simplicity.
  Add networking so that the players can play fairly (or at least some kind of pause to let players switch).
  Make this a deployable package.
