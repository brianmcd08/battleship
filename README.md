# battleship
2 player game currently in development. 

Done:
backend game logic
unit tests

To Do:
Clean up main.py. I know very little about pygame and this feels very hacky.
Add End of Game condition checking in main and remove the hard-coded loop.
Uncomment the rest of the ship types. They're currently commented for front-end testing simplicity.
Add networking so that the players can play fairly (or at least some kind of pause to let players switch).
Make this a deployable package.
